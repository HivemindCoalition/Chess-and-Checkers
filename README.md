Chess-and-Checkers
==================

A single-system multiplayer game that allows users to play chess or checkers.

This game was developed from scratch using the standard java libraries.

Both games were made to enforce their respective official rules.

#Play

I will add a link to the game as an applet in the near future.

#Notes
- I will most likely update the game art for better quality in the near future.
- This code can be refactored in some places. If you would like to send a pull request, feel free to.
- I took out a lot of the comments we used during the development process (They were too messy for my standards to publicize). If you are interested in the source that contains the developer comments, send me an email (tcaldwel@nmsu.edu). The code should be pretty straight forward, and readable otherwise.
