If you would like to send a pull request, feel free to.\r\n- I took out a lot of the comments we used during the development process (They were too messy for my standards to publicize). If you are interested in the source that contains the developer comments, send me an email (tcaldwel@nmsu.edu). The code should be pretty straight forward, and readable otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
