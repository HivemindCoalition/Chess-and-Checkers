If you would like to send a pull request, feel free to.\r\n- I took out a lot of the comments we used during the development process (They were too messy for my standards to publicize). If you are interested in the source that contains the developer comments, send me an email (tcaldwel@nmsu.edu). The code should be pretty straight forward, and readable otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n#FAQ\r\n\r\n**Q:** Why am I forced to make a capture in Checkers?\r\n\r\n**A:** This was one of the official rules our game is based around. Some versions of Checkers don't follow this rule, ours does.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q:** Is there a single player mode?\r\n\r\n**A:** You can't currently play single player. We have talked about implementing single player and network multiplayer in the future, but are currently busy with other side projects. No promises.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q:** What is the Debug Menu option, and why is it disabled?\r\n\r\n**A:** A menu that displayed game information and data to help us debug and develop quicker. It is disabled in the applet because it won't be of any use to you. A watered down version of the one we used is available in the jar version.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q:** Why does the board flip after every turn?\r\n\r\n**A:** We figured players would like to face their opponent when making a move. We have talked about ways of improving this transition, and making it more pleasing to the eye. This is something we could potentially work on in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q:** Can I use the source code/game art for my project?\r\n\r\n**A:** No.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
